In this section, you will find information on *[red]#Test Folder#* in Cerberus.
A *[red]#Test Folder#* is just a way to group and classify your test case. Every test case must be attached to a unique *[red]#Test Folder#*. Inside the same *[red]#Test Folder#*, every test case must have a different id. 2 test cases can have the same id if they belong to 2 different *[red]#Test Folder#*.
