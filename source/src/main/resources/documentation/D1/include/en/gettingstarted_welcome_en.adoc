=== Homepage

The homepage is showing information on ::
* testcases set by application grouped by status (See the <<workflow>> section for more information);
* testcase executions by tag  (the last ones by default, or customizable as described in the <<Customization>> section);
* the application versions deployed on environment;

==== Customization

You can customize the list of tag in a static way by selecting the tags from the combo.

But you can also define a search text that will be used to dynamicaly retreive the list of tag.

* *TestCase* : Test scenario made of steps, actions and controls. (User story implementation in Cerberus)
* *Label* : Mark to describe TestCases, so you can group and filter easily.
* *Campaign* : Group of testcases (selected using labels) all linked to execution parameters (country - environment - browser - robot (optional)).

==== Representation

You will find in this section a graphical representation of the main Cerberus elements.

==== Tutorials

*First steps as an administrator*

NOTE: For non-admin users, please go to the next section : "First steps"

You will find below setting steps for an application to test.

* Create a system. More information here <<Invariants>>

NOTE: _Check you are on the system you have just created (dropdown menu at top right)_ image:homepagesystem.png[MenuSystem,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

* Create an environment.  Example : PROD FR (see <<Environment>>) 
* Create an application. Example : Google (see <<Application>>)
* Edit once again your application, you can now set new parameters. In tab environment, create PROD FR environment and fill http://www.google.fr in host section.

Technical settings are now finished. Please refer to the following section to implement a TestCase.

*First steps* 

NOTE: Please verify with your administrator if system and application are already created.

You will find below step to create and execute a TestCase.

* Optionally you can created one or several Test Folder in order to host your test cases. Example : « Search Engine » (see <<Create test>>)
* Access to TestCase list  and create a TestCase (cf <<Create TestCase>>). Mandatory fields : Test /  Application / TestCase ID (Should already be filled with a reference).

NOTE: _Activation criteria tab : Activate for PROD your TestCase. (default setting not active for PROD) For the example, We will run our TestCase on PROD environment_

* Your TestCase is now created, find it in the list using filters. 
* Edit it (cf <<Implement TestCase>>)
* Create your first step « Open Google »
* Add your first action : *[red]#OpenURL#* value =   www.google.com  or *[red]#OpenURLWithBase#* value =  /  (if URL is already defined in application settings)
* You can add a control : *[red]#VerifyTitle#* Title = Google
* Save the script and click on Run button.
* You are now on execution page. Select country / environment
* Fill robot information. Mandatory fields :  IP / port / browser. 

NOTE: _You must first run your selenium server (see <<Selenium>>)_

* Click on the execution button. image:runbuttonexecution.png[BoutonRun,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

*Congratulations, you've just executed your first Cerberus TestCase !*
