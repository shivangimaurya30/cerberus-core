=== Test Case Property

When clicking on Tab image:buttonmanageproperties.png[buttonManageProperties], the Property menu will appear.
From there you can manage your TestCase properties or see your Inherited Properties - coming from the step libraries of your use steps.

Properties are the key element of your Test Case to manage different variables in the same scenario. A property is identified by its name and the country for which it's defined (e.g. you cannot have two properties defined for the same country with the same name).

Properties can be called by their name using the following syntaxes:

- `%property.property_name%` : the execution will **stop** if any problem in the property calculation
- `%property_name_here%` : the execution will **not stop** if any problem in the property calculation

When handling Datalib, the syntaxes to call the subdata are :

- `%property.property_name.sub_data_name%` or `%property_name.sub_data_name%`
- `%property.property_name(sub_data_name)%` or `%property_name(sub_data_name)%`

Properties can be called in action or control values field or in another property.

|=== 

| *Field* | *Description*  

| Property | Name of the property.

| Description | Description of the property.

| Countries | Countries for which the property will be calculated (environment parameter).

| Type | The way the property is going to be calculated.

| Value | Value of the property.

| DB | DataBase in which the property will be calculated. Used by "executeSql" Property type.

| Length | When calculating a list of values, defines the number of rows the property will return.

| Row Limit | When returning a list of values, limits the number of rows the property will consider for random purposes.

| Nature | Defines the unique value that will be used in the execution. By default, STATIC has no rules defined : it will take the first result it finds. RANDOM will pick a random value if several rows are available. RANDOMNEW will pick a random value that was never selected before in any older execution. NOTINUSE will pick a value that is not currently used by a running execution.

| Nb of retry | When the property fail to retrieve any data, it can retry several times to get the data. That data define the nb of retry after which it will stop trying and report a NA status.

| Retry Period | Defines the period in millisecond between every retry.

| Cache Expire | Defines the amount of time in second during which the property can be kept in cache. 0 value disable the cache mecanisme.

| Rank | If 1 the property is considered as a primary property and will always be displayed on execution detail. From 2 to higher value, the property will be considered as secondary and will be hidden by default from execution report.

==== Property Types

|=== 

| *Field* | *Description* | *Example*  

| text | assign the property an alphanumeric value. Can invoke other properties | `%system.EXECUTIONID%_test`

| getFromDataLib | query the corresponding datalib (identified by its name) | `Datalib_Name`

| getFromSQL | run a specific query an get the first, and only the first, result. The DB must be specified | `select TestCase from testcasestepactioncontrol where Control = 'verifyElementInElement'`

| getFromHtml |  | 

| getFromHtmlVisible |  | 

| getElementPosition |  | 

| getFromJS | Execute the specified JavaScript script without getting any output | `var xPathRes = document.evaluate ("//*[@data-cerberus='button_basket_ProductBloc_modifyProduct1']", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null); xPathRes.singleNodeValue.click();`

| getAttributeFromHtml |  | 

| getFromCookie | Get a cookie information from a cookie name and a given parameter. | Cookie name = JSESSIONID / Gookie parameter = (name,value,expiry,domain,path,isHttpOnly,isSecure)

| getRawFromJson | Get element from a JSON content in a JSON format | `$.status`

| getFromCommand |  | 

| getFromGroovy | Execute the specified Groovy script and get the last defined variable. Test your scripts easily using the  https://groovyconsole.appspot.com[online console] | `'%property.date%'.replace('\','-').substring(0,10)`

===== SQL queries management:

- queries can be stored inside the test case and launched using getFromSQL. Only one value of the first row can be retrieved.

- queries can be stored inside a Datalib, according to its DB. Several values of the first row can be retrieved.

We recommend to use the Datalib since it allow SQL to be dynamically reused from one test case to another.

=== Test Case Variables

You can use variables in many area of Cerberus. Those variable are used in order to perform some actions of controls in a dynamic way.
3 types of variables can be created :

- Variables defined from **properties** inside Test Cases.
- Variables defined from **application object**.
- **System** Variables

Properties and Application Object are defined by the users while system variable are provided by Cerberus.

The global syntax of a variable is :
%[property|object|system].nameOfTheVariable%

This is the list of fields in Cerberus where you can use those variables.

- All Test Cases, Steps, Actions and Control descriptions.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Step Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Action Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Control Test Case level.
- Test Case Action Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.
- Test Case Control Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.
- Test Case Properties Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.
- Path, Envelope and Method at Test Data Library (SOAP) level.
- SQL Script at Test Data Library (SQL) level
- Column, Parsing Answer and Column Position at Test Data Library Subdata definition level
- Path, Request, Operation and Attachment URL at Service level.
- Request detail (all keys and values) and Header (all keys and values) at Service level.

When a variable is detected in one of those field, Cerberus will replace it by the value during the execution.

- If the variable is an object, the value (that never change) is just replaced.
- If the variable is a system variable, the value is calculated and replaced at the same time (for ex : time defined by %system.TODAY-D% will be the day and time of the replacement).
- If the variable is a property, it gets automatically calculated at the time of the replacement. If it was already calculated before, the same value (already calculated) is replaced.
NOTE: In order to force the calculation of a property at a certain timing, _calculateProperty_ Action can be inserted just before the action is used in a field.

Variables can be defined in a recursive way.
That means that the following syntax :

`%property.**%system.COUNTRY%**%` will be first replaced by

`%property.FR%` and then by FR property value (if it exist).

Please note also that, if at the end of the decode operation, there are still references to %property.???% or %system.???% or %object.%%% in the field, the corresponding test case will report an error and generate an FA status.

==== Property Variables

Property variable allow to have multi row content.
As a consequence the full syntax will look like this :

`%property.NameOfTheVariable.rowNb.SubData%`

NOTE: If rowNb is not defined, the 1st row will be used. As a consequence, the syntax `%property.nameOfTheVariable%` is the same as `%property.1.nameOfTheVariable%`
If SubData is not defined, the 'key' subdata will be used (ie, correspond to the empty subdata).

NOTE: You can also get the nb of rows your variable has by using the `**nbrows**` reserved word of the property :
`%property.NameOfTheVariable.**nbrows**%`

==== Object Variables

- `%object.myobject.**value**%` : Get the application object value of myobject
- `%object.myobject.**picturepath**%` : Get the application object picture path of the file of myobject (that will be replaced by local path of the file)
- `%object.myobject.**pictureurl**%` : Get the application object picture URL of the file of myobject (that will be replaced by a URL that provide the file content)
- `%object.myobject.**base64**%` : Get the application object base64 value of the file of myobject

==== Tricks

You will find below some tricks which help you to implement specific test cases.

NOTE: It is possible to create a random property with a number of char defined. You have to feed the property fields like the screenshot below. This property will be different for each execution. Example: 8e4!9EsT5-GfZvJ3oZ7v
Charset can be limited to any values by using Value field.
