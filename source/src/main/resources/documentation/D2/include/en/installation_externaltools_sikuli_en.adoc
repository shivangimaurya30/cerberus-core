==== Sikuli installation

http://sikulix.com/[Sikuli] is an open source project that automates anything you see on the screen 
of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV 
to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's 
internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on..

This procedure covers installation and configuration of **SikuliX 1.1.1**.

[NOTE]
.Sikuli have to be installed only on the server where the test will run (on the robot server)!
=================================================
Cerberus will interact with Sikuli that will control the system on which the test will be executed. Please notice that Sikuli have not to be installed on
the Cereberus Server, but only on robot server.
=================================================

===== Prerequisites

SikuliX can be used on systems with : +


- Windows XP and later including Windows 8 and 10 (32-Bit or 64-Bit)
- Mac OSX 10.6 and later including 10.10 and 10.11 (64-Bit only)
- Linux/Unix systems depending on the availability of the prerequisites (32-Bit or 64-Bit)


In any case you must have a valid Java installation of at least Java 7 (JRE (runtime only) or JDK (runtime + development kit)). 
It is highly recommended, to always have the latest stable Oracle/Sun Java version on your system 
(currently Java 8, does not work with Java 9). 
Equivalent versions of OpenJDK should work as well and are recommended on Linux systems..

On 64-Bit capable systems a Java 64-Bit version is strongly recommended. 
SikuliX will detect Java's bitness at runtime and select the fitting native library set automatically. 
So you might freely switch between different Java versions with the same SikuliX on one machine.

===== Installation

After having downloaded sikulixsetup.jar, you should consider the following recommendations, before doing anything: +

- select a prominent folder that is intended, to permanently contain all artifacts making up SikuliX
- the path to this folder and its name should not contain any blanks or special characters (example: C:\SikuliX)
- the folder should not be a program or application folder with special system access restrictions (must be freely user writeable)
into this folder copy/move sikulixsetup....jar



. launch sikulixsetup.jar
. Choose either the option 1 (Full package with IDE) or the option 2.
. After having made your selections, click the button [Setup Now].

If everything works well, after successful internal download of the needed packages, 
you will get some intermediate yellow badges, hopefully positive popups from the tests and a final success message. 


-- You might find the following files in your SikuliX setup folder:

--------------------------------------
SikuliX-1.1.0-SetupLog.txt --- contains debug information of setup workflow
sikulixsetup-1.1.0.jar (might have a lengthy version suffix)
runsikulix(.cmd) --- command script for commandline usages of SikuliX
sikulix.jar --- (non-Mac systems only) SikuliX IDE and scripting support (option 1)
SikuliX.app --- (Mac systems) Mac application, should be moved to /Applications (option 1)
sikulixapi.jar --- Java programming support (option2)
--------------------------------------


[NOTE]
See official documentation http://sikulix.com/quickstart/[here] for more details.


===== Connect Cerberus to Sikuli

You'll need to download the project https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-extension-sikuli[cerberus-extension-sikuli] 
to interface Cerberus with your sikuli server.


. Download the https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-extension-sikuli[cerberus-extension-sikuli].
. Download Selenium http://www.seleniumhq.org/download[Standalone Server].
. Unzip cerberus-extension-sikuli and put the cerberus-extension-sikuli-x.x.x-full.jar it in the same folder than the selenium server.
. Create a bat/sh file with the following command lines:

- For a FAT Client

No needs of selenium server, you can use this cerberus extention in a standalone mode (since cerberus-extension-sikuli-1.1.0-full).
--------------------------------------
start /b java -jar cerberus-extension-sikuli-x.x.x-full.jar
--------------------------------------

- For a WebApplication

Injecting the main servlet of this cerberus extension starting the selenium hub. 
--------------------------------------
start /b java -jar selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar -role hub -port 5555
start /b java -cp selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar;cerberus-extension-sikuli-x.x.x.jar org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher -role node -hub http://localhost:5555/grid/register -port 5556 -servlets org.sikuliserver.ExecuteSikuliAction
--------------------------------------

==== OCR setting

OCR (optical character recognition) can be enabled with sikuli, please follow the procedure below to set sikuli.

- When installing Sikulie, select option 3 :

- When installation is done, run sikuli IDE. Click on File > Preferences > More options Then select toolboxes Allow searching for text / Allow OCR : 

image:installationOCRsettings.PNG[OCRsettings]

Cerberus should now be able to find text.
