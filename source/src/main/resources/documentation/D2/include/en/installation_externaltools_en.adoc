For each application type there is a specific engine to run tests under it. For instance, Web applications will be handled by the http://www.seleniumhq.org/[Selenium] Web browser automation tool.

The main goal of Cerberus is to gather this tool ecosystem to provide a common way to describe and run tests, whatever the kind of application type.

Hereafter the list of compatible application types and their associated external tool:
