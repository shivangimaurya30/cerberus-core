*Improvements / New features*
[square]
* Event Hooks implementation allowing to configure any action attached a list of supported events (9) : CAMPAIGN_START, CAMPAIGN_END, CAMPAIGN_END_CIKO, EXECUTION_START, EXECUTION_END, EXECUTION_END_LASTRETRY, TESTCASE_CREATE, TESTCASE_UPDATE, TESTCASE_DELETE
* 5 connectors can be used to those events : EMAIL, SLACK, TEAMS, GOOGLE-CHAT, GENERIC. When event occurs, Cerberus will notify the chosen associated system in a native format using those connectors. That allow an easier integration of Cerberus to any external tool. New connectors can also be implemented in a much easier way.
* New version of GetTagDetails (V002) with more information on extracted Tag data (using the same public JSON format than the one used on the GENERIC event hook connector).
* SYSTEM, COUNTRY and ENVIRONMENT invariants are controlled when created or updated to secure they are have less than 45 digits and don't contains any specific characters. #2265
* Support dragAndDrop action for FAT applications (and hybrid web testing).
* Documentation split into 3 sections : *General documentation* on GUI and main Cerberus concepts, *Administration documentation* on installation, API and Events, *Use Case documentation* that contains how to on main use cases.
* New element identifier : querySelector that allow testing of webpages using shadowDOM technics (such as Salesforce).
* New Developer section on menu that point to API swagger documentation and EventHook configuration
* First set of public API available in Swagger section (still experimental - use it with care as signatures are not yet fully stable)
