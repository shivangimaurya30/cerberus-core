===== IOS

====== Installation

. Install _Xcode_ 8.1+
. Install the _Apple Developer Tools_ via this http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html[external documentation]
. Follow the complete procedure from this https://hasaanali.wordpress.com/2016/12/01/install-appium-v1-6-from-terminal-setup-for-ios/[external documentation] and apply the following commands and fixes:
.. https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage\[_Carthage_] cannot be installed via _npm_ but _brew_. Thus, install _Carthage_ by executing:
+
--------------------------------------
brew install carthage
--------------------------------------
+
.. Execute the following additional commands:
+
--------------------------------------
npm install -g ios-deploy --unsafe-perm=true
npm install -g deviceconsole
brew uninstall ideviceinstaller
brew uninstall libimobiledevice
brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice
brew unlink libimobiledevice && brew link libimobiledevice
brew install ideviceinstaller
brew unlink ideviceinstaller && brew link ideviceinstaller
--------------------------------------

[CAUTION]
.Note about the current Appium version from _npm_
=====================================================================
At the time of writing, the installed Appium version (1.6.2) from the above procedure doesn't work properly with Cerberus. Only the 1.6.3-SNAPSHOT version was able to correctly start application.
The following commands will help you to install the latest version of Appium (extracted from the https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/contributing-to-appium/appium-from-source.md[official documentation]):
--------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/appium/appium.git
cd appium
npm install -g mocha
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
gulp transpile
--------------------------------------
=====================================================================

[[installation_externaltools_appium_en_appium_server_installation_application_sign_configuration]]
====== Application sign configuration

The latest version of Appium uses the https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver[appium-xcuitest-driver] which depend on the https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent[Web Driver Agent] that need to be deployed on the tested device. Thus, the Appium server's host needs to be configured to be allowed to deploy application on tested device.

Appium server's host must:

. Have its associated Apple account registered to a https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ManagingYourTeam/ManagingYourTeam.html[Apple Team Development]
. Have downloaded the _iOS Development_ signing identity associated to the registered Apple Team Development
. Have downloaded a provisioning profile associated to the registered Apple Team Development that allow:
** **at least** the _Web Driver Agent_ application (identified by the `com.facebook.WebDriverAgentLib` bundle identifier)
** the tested device to install the _Web Driver Agent_ application

Once all of these previous prerequisities are met, then create a _appium.xcconfig_ file and fill it with the following lines (where `<Team ID>` is your Development Team identifier):
--------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <Team ID>
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = iPhone Developer
--------------------------------------

This file will be used further by execution. Look at the <<installation_externaltools_appium_en_appium_server_installation_run, Run>> section for more details.

[[installation_externaltools_appium_en_appium_server_installation_run]]
===== Run

Run Appium server can differ following the way you installed it.

====== Installation from npm

If Appium has been installed from _npm_, then simply starts Appium server by executing:

--------------------------------------
appium
--------------------------------------

====== Installation from Appium sources

If Appium has been installed from its sources, we encourage to create an executable file to start and configure Appium server more easily. Then:

. Create a _appium_ file and fill it with the following lines
+
--------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/appium/sources && node . "$@"
--------------------------------------
+
. Make this file executable
+
--------------------------------------
chmod +x /path/to/the/appium/file
--------------------------------------
+
. Locate the root directory of this executable file and add it to your `PATH` variable by adding this line to your _~/.bash_profile_ (or any terminal session start) file:
+
--------------------------------------
export PATH=/path/to/the/appium/file/root/directory:$PATH
--------------------------------------
+
. Restart your terminal session
. Start Appium server by executing
+
--------------------------------------
appium
--------------------------------------
+


[[installation_externaltools_appium_en_note_for_IOS_application_testing]]
====== Note for IOS application testing

As viewed from <<installation_externaltools_appium_en_appium_server_installation_application_sign_configuration, previous section>>, Appium has to deal with Apple application sign.
This could be done by sending the `xcodeConfigFile` capability to the Appium server.

But you may want to use the same value for any request, because the Apple Development Team is often unique within an organization.
It could be the same for the `realDeviceLogger` capability because Appium can always using https://github.com/appium/deviceconsole[deviceconsole] as real device logger.

This can be achieved by starting the Appium server with the `--default-capabilities` option and giving it the list of default capabilities.
For maintenance reason, we recommend to delegate definition of the list of capabilities into a JSON file as the following:

. Create a file named _common.caps_ (for instance)
. Fill it with your default capabilities
+
--------------------------------------
{
    "xcodeConfigFile": "/path/to/appium.xcconfig",
	"realDeviceLogger": "/usr/local/lib/node_modules/deviceconsole/deviceconsole"
}
--------------------------------------
+
. Then start Appium server by executing
+
--------------------------------------
appium --default-capabilities /path/to/common.caps
--------------------------------------
+


[[installation_externaltools_appium_en_client_use]]
==== Client use

The following section will show different use cases to connect to the Appium server.


===== Execute mobile test case with Cerberus

Once you wrote your test case, Cerberus can execute it to the desired mobile by configuring the associated Robot

Inside Cerberus, open the Robot page (Run -> Robot), and, depending on the application type, fill the Robot with the following configuration:

====== Android

image:robotandroiddefinition.png[Robot definition]

image:robotandroidcapabilities.png[Robot capabilities]

[NOTE]
Values are given as example. feel free to modify them according to your needs.

====== IOS

image:robotiosdefinition.png[Robot definition]

image:robotioscapabilities.png[Robot capabilities]

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
Values are given as example. feel free to modify them according to your needs.

The two last capabilities `xcodeConfigFile` and `realDeviceLogger` are not necessary if given at Appium startup. See the <<installation_externaltools_appium_en_note_for_IOS_application_testing, previous section>> for more details.
=====================================================================


===== Inspection

Inspection is used to locate application’s element by identifier, XPath, etc. Theses values can so be use inside Cebrerus to describe automated test cases.

Inspection can be done by using the Appium client interface.

====== Installation

Install latest client from the https://bitbucket.org/appium/appium.app/downloads/[official page].

====== Configuration

Appium client interface **has to be configured to be only used for inspection**. to have application’s element XPath for instance):

From the General settings menu:

* Fill the _Server address_ input field with the Appium server address
* Fill the _Port_ input field with the Appium server port
* Unable the _Use Remote Server_ option

image:appiumclientinterfacegeneralsettings.png[General settings]

For Android case, open the Android settings menu and:

* Fill the _App Path_ with the absolute path (or URL) of the application APK
* Fill the _Platform Name_ by `Android`
* Fill the _Automation Name_ by `Appium`
* Fill the _Platform Version_ by your device platform version
* Fill the _Device Name_ by your device name

image:appiumclientinterfaceandroidsettings.png[Android settings]

For IOS case, open the IOS settings menu and:

* Fill the _App Path_ with the absolute path (or URL) of the application IPA
* Fill the _Force device_ input filed by your device name
* Fill the _Platform version_ input field by your platform version. It must be lower or equal than your Xcode SDK supported version (for instance, 10.1 by using Xcode 8).
* Fill the _UDID_ input field by your device's UDID number

image:appiumclientinterfaceiossettings.png[IOS settings]

====== Run

Once Appium client is correctly configured, simply click on the Android or IOS radio button following the application definition and then click on the Inspector button.
